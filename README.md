SpaceAI is a comprehensive library designed for space mission data analysis and machine learning model benchmarking. It provides tools for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, specifically tailored for space-related datasets. The library includes implementations of various machine learning models, such as ESNs (Echo State Networks) and LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks), and offers a range of utilities to facilitate the development and testing of these models. With SpaceAI, researchers and engineers can streamline their workflow and focus on deriving insights from space mission data.
